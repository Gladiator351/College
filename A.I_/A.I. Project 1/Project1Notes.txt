Summary

Basically what we're doing is writing a neural network.
What that means is we're going to take in a certain set of
inputs (4 in our case) and end up with an output (one of 4 
possible.) There will be a hidden layer that performs a
function (Sigmoid) on the inputs.

Specifics

This is going to be powering a game. So there are 4 vectors
of input: Health, Has-Knife, Has-Gun, and Enemies. There can
be a number of values for each input (from 0 to something higher.)
There are 4 possible outcomes or behaviors that the character
should take depending on the situation, which depends on the
inputs. Those 4 behaviors are: Attack, Run, Wander, or Hide.
See Table 3 in the instructions for the desired outputs for
each permutation of input values.
